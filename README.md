# SW-MCU-STM32-EPPROM-017

Here is test setup:

<img width="658" alt="test" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1548e4f-26a8-41f0-ae34-9979b767eccf">

I used AT24C256 with 0.96 inch screen. 

Demonstration:

Reading a float number from EPPROM.

Your data will be safe even if epprom is disconnected or MCU loose its power. You can plug it back , data will be there.

You can use and adapt this code to any type of projects that need a EPPROM. Use it wisely.

Hope this helps you,
